## About the Project

Classic Ford Cars is a fictitious car dealers website whereby users can view a selection of classic Ford cars, such as Capri, Mustang, GT40 and Ford Rally Cars.

By inputting a Stripe test credit card, users will be able to purchase these cars. I aim to make this website as authentic as possible.

The project will be built utilising, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python and Django to the best of my capabilities.

All design decisions have been made with the following goals in mind:
- To be accessible to users with disabilities.

- Easy to find your way around.
- Responsiveness design.

# DESIGN

## Website Typography
For the Classic Ford Cars logo, I chose Parisienne obtained from Google Fonts. I liked it because it's similiar to the original Ford logo.

### About Parisienne
Parisienne is a casual connecting script inspired by a 1960s Bra advertisement! It has a slight bounce and intentional irregularity to what might other wise appear to be a more formal script font. Classic, yet free spirited, it is a typestyle for a wide variety of use.

![Logo text](wireframes/logo_text.png)

For all body and heading text, I'll be using Noto Sans. I decided to use this font because it's a nice clean design and looks well on both Mac and PC displays.

### About Noto Sans
This is the Sans-Serif Latin, Greek and Cyrillic and Devanagari family. It has Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic styles and is hinted. It has a Serif sister family, Noto Serif.

Noto fonts for many other languages are available as web fonts in Google Fonts Early Access.

## Colour Scheme

Below is a colour palette generated from [coolors](https://coolors.co/), which will be used throughout the website. 

- Body background colour will be the off-white #F7FFF7

- Footer and main body text will be the charcoal black #343434

The remainding colours will be used for buttons and navigational links.

## Website Imagery

All images of the Ford cars have been sourced from [Dreamstime](https://www.dreamstime.com).

One large hero image will cover half of the homepage. The main navbar will have a transparency background as to not take away from the main inmagery.

In order to make it look like a genuine car dealers, I think it would look good if below the hero image, I had images of "employees". This feature came as an after thought prior to doing my wireframes.
