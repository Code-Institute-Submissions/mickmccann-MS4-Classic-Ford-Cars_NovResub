# CLASSIC FORD CARS

## About the Project

Classic Ford Cars is a fictitious car dealers website whereby users can view a selection of classic Ford cars, such as Capri, Mustang, GT40 and Ford Rally Cars.

By inputting a Stripe test credit card, users will be able to purchase these cars. I aim to make this website as authentic as possible.

The project will be built utilising, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python and Django to the best of my capabilities.

All design decisions have been made with the following goals in mind:
- To be accessible to users with disabilities.

- Easy to find your way around.
- Responsiveness design.
